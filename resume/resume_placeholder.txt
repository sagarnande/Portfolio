Instructions for adding your resume PDF:

1. Place your resume PDF file named "Sagar_Nande_Resume.pdf" in this "resume" folder.
2. Make sure the file name matches exactly: "Sagar_Nande_Resume.pdf" 
3. If your resume has a different filename, either rename your file or update the link in index.html.

The resume icon in your portfolio will now link directly to this PDF file, allowing visitors to view or download your resume.

Note: Your resume should be well-formatted and professional, as it's an important part of your portfolio presentation.
